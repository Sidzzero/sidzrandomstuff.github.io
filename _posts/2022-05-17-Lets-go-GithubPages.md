I have finally setup Github Pages to Re(x10 time))Start my Blogging !
To begin with, I got the basic  flow of githubpages through the 
free learning available on github itself.(Duh)
It was a Fun way to learn actually, while learning the basic, I was also looking 
at the how the lessons where presented.
They used issues, pull request and a BOT to present all the the learning
outcomes. 
Pretty cool I though.
Anyways, I will now offically start posting my months/Years of content which I wanted to blog about
in a simplelistic environment.

Hold-on Traveller, your in for ride......
